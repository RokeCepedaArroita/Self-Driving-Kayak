Seashark 300A ESC with BEC

4.82 kg for 50 Ah, so worth it!!


Take servo lead from speed controller into the servo side of the servo tester (not the power side)

To make motor go in reverse, just reverse the red and black connections (not the signal one). Actually ANY TWO OF THE THREE WIRES.

BEC (battery eliminator circuit) comes out of the speed controller, provides 5V. 

When arming ESC, value of servo tester should be low. Actually, if you keep it high for 2 sec, the low for 2 sec, you will calibrate the ESC 

Some high power ESC don't have 5V BEC


Need connectors too!!! And wire clipper 

Maximum expected range (3 km/h, 30 Ah at 100W) is 11.5 km. If invest in 40 Ah, could run for 5 hours or 15 km. Definitely doable Gorliz - Bilbao. Maximum to consider is 60 AH (7h) Minimum to consider 30 Ah (3.5h). 

The watt meter should have a peak readout and a Wh measurement to keep track of battery usage. The GT Power 180A will do this. 

Soldering: add flux, then add lots of solder to each end, then solder the two terminals together. Use heat shrink to protect the connection. 

ESC 20% more than motor

Motor: 50W (min), 67W (mid), 130W (max). Aim for 80W. 8 cm diameter. IPX8 up to 1 meter.
